# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## By Stacey Booysen

In this project, we worked with Bobby to work through lists of information on employees at the company Pewlett Hackard. Due to the usage of older methods, the large amount of data in this longstanding company, had not been kept in an easy to filter manner. 

We worked to combine and organize the employee data to answer very specific questions that the company higher-ups need to know. The information is critical in order to predict the amount of employees that may retire soon, as well as predicting the positions that will open up and need to be filled as a result.

Our first step was to filter by the position-types that the retiring group occupied. This would give a good idea of just which positions and how many of them would need to be filled. As shown below, there are a very high number of Senior-level positions that may become vacant soon.

Once we had the titles sorted, we needed to filter out those who could potentially be eligible for mentorship programs. This is something very necessary considering the vital positions of many employees on the retirement list. As shown below, we can already see that many of them will be leaving very complicated positions that will require a lot of training for anyone new coming in to take over.

In conclusion, there is a large chunk of the company workforce that could be retiring soon. This will leave countless open positions that will need to be filled as soon as possible. With this updated information, the company should be able to start scouting for potential employees to fill those positions and work with their higher-ranking members to learn how to do the jobs that will require the most training and prep. In turn, if they train existing employees to take over more complex positions, they will also need to look into hiring for lower-ranking positions which will open up as a result. Luckily, the data should help to provide more insight if they need more statistics on any number of the employees they have.
